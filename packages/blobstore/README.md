# blobstore

The `blobstore` module provides a unified interface for storing, retrieving, and deleting files (known as **blobs**) in
various storage backends.
Its primary goal is to offer a convenient abstraction layer, enabling applications to switch between different storage
implementations without changing core business logic.
